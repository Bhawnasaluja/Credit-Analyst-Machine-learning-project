# Credit-Analyst-Machine-learning-project
Credit Analyst - Machine Learning Project Welcome to the Credit Analyst machine learning project! 
**Project Overview**
Credit risk assessment is crucial in the financial industry. By leveraging machine learning, we analyze loan applicants' data to predict their creditworthiness. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

**Features**
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes data distributions, identifies correlations, and uncovers patterns.
Model Building: Implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to predict loan status.
Model Evaluation: Assesses model performance using accuracy metrics on both training and test data.
Dataset
The dataset includes features like an applicant's credit history, loan amount, income, and employment status. (Source: [mention source]).

**Data Collection and Processing:** Load and preprocess the dataset.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generate visualizations to better understand the data.
**Train Test Split:** Split data into training and testing sets.
**Model Training:** Train the SVM model.
**Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance.
**Results**
Model performance metrics and visualizations are documented in the repository. The final model and predictions are available in the models directory.
